            This Publica Marketplace Platform Agreement, including any terms and policies incorporated herein by
            reference (collectively the &quot;Agreement&quot;) sets forth the terms under which QueryLoop, Inc., d/b/a
            Publica (&quot;Publica&quot;) makes the Publica Marketplace Platform (the &quot;Platform&quot;) available to
            you and the company or organization on behalf of whom you are registering (&quot;Seller&quot;). The Platform
            will enable Seller to create and customize an online store or library (the &quot;Seller Store&quot;) whereby
            Seller will be able to make certain digital publications and other content provided by Seller (the
            &quot;Seller Content&quot;) and/or certain digital publications or other content which Publica makes
            available to Seller through the Platform (the &quot;Marketplace Content&quot;) available for sale or other
            distribution to end users through the Platform (&quot;End Users&quot;). Together, the Seller Content and the
            Marketplace Content offered through the Seller Store is referred to as the &quot;Store Content.&quot; By
            registering or using Seller&apos;s account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept this
            Agreement and act on behalf of the Seller. This Agreement supersedes and replaces all prior agreements and
            terms that relate to Seller&apos;s use of the Platform, including, as applicable, the Unlimited Service Sale
            Agreement, the Sales & Revenue Share Agreement, and the SaaS and Sales Agreement and Terms of Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            Publica may change the terms of this Agreement any time in its sole discretion upon thirty (30) days&apos;
            notice to Seller (or such different notice period as specific in the notice) (the &quot;Notice
            Period&quot;). The changes will be effective at the end of the Notice Period, and Seller&apos;s continued
            use of the Platform after the end of the Notice Period, including offering any Products for sale on the
            Platform, constitutes Seller&apos;s acceptance of such changes. If Seller does not agree to any changes,
            Seller must discontinue all use of the Platform and remove all of its Seller Content prior to the end of the
            Notice Period.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Subscription Plans; Cancellation</h3>
          <p>
            Use of the Platform is subject to the terms of this Agreement as well as the features, limitations, and
            other requirements of the applicable subscription plan (or plans) that Seller has selected (the
            &quot;Subscription Plan&quot;). The features, limitations, and requirements for each Subscription Plan,
            including any applicable Subscription Fees (as defined below), are as set forth on the Publica.la website
            (the &quot;Site&quot;) at{" "}
            <Link href="/pricing" className="text-primary hover:underline">
              /pricing
            </Link>
            . Subscription Plans that require subscription fees have subscription terms that are monthly, annually, or
            such other terms as may be offered by Publica and selected by Seller (the &quot;Subscription Term&quot;).
            Seller may change or cancel its Subscription Plan at any time by emailing Publica at{" "}
            <Link href="mailto:support@publica.la" className="text-primary hover:underline">
              support@publica.la
            </Link>
            . However, no refunds of any Subscription Fees will be provided in connection with any change or
            cancellation of the Subscription Term, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as
            required by applicable law. The Subscription Term will automatically renew at the end of each term (each a
            &quot;Renewal Term&quot;) unless Seller cancels prior the end of the previous term by emailing Publica at{" "}
            <Link href="mailto:support@publica.la" className="text-primary hover:underline">
              support@publica.la
            </Link>{" "}
            (or Publica terminates Seller in accordance with Section 12 below). It is solely Seller&apos;s
            responsibility to cancel the Subscription before the end of the current Subscription Term, in order to stop
            the Subscription Term from being renewed. The features, limitations, requirements of any Subscription Plan
            may be changed by Publica at any time upon written notice, provided that such changes will not go into
            effect until the end of the Subscription Term (if applicable).
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Free Trials</h3>
          <p>
            From time to time, we may offer free trials or other promotional subscriptions (a &quot;Trial
            Subscription&quot;) that will automatically convert into a paid subscription after the end of a certain
            period of time (the &quot;Promotion Period&quot;).{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">
              SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER MUST CANCEL THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION BY EMAILING PUBLICA AT{" "}

              BEFORE THE END OF THE PROMOTION PERIOD IN ORDER TO AVOID CONVERTING TO A STANDARD SUBSCRIPTION AND BEING
              CHARGED A SUBSCRIPTION FEE, AND SELLER AUTHORIZES PUBLICA TO CHARGE THE PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDED IN
              CONNECTION WITH THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR ALL SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND OTHER AMOUNTS AS SET FORM IN SECTION
              3.2 BELOW IF SELLER HAS NOT CANCELLED AS SET FORTH ABOVE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE PROMOTION PERIOD.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Seller's Obligations</h3>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.1 Registration</h4>
          <p>
            To activate the Seller Store, Seller must create an account (the &quot;Account&quot;) and provide all
            information requested by Publica during Account activation, and the Seller Store must be accepted by Publica
            (which acceptance is at the sole discretion of Publica). Seller must provide Publica with accurate, complete
            and updated information, and will promptly update Account information in the event of any changes to such
            information. Failure to do so is a breach of this Agreement and may result in termination of Seller&apos;s
            Account and rights to use the Platform. Seller will maintain the security and confidentiality of its account
            information, including the passwords used to access its Account, and is responsible for all activities
            performed in the Platform with its Account information.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.2 Fees; Automatic Renewal</h4>
          <p>
            Certain Subscription Plans may require payment of a one-time set up fee (the &quot;Set-Up Fee&quot;) and/or
            a subscription fee (the &quot;Subscription Fee&quot;), as set forth on our Site at{" "}
            <Link href="/pricing" className="text-primary hover:underline">
              /pricing
            </Link>
            . In addition, Publica reserves the right to charge the following transaction fees: (a) a transaction fee of
            $0.43 on each End User transaction in the event that the Revenue Share (as defined below) on such
            transaction is not sufficient to cover the fees charged by Publica&apos;s payment processor or as otherwise
            specified in the applicable Subscription Plan; and (b) a transaction fee of $1.00 if Seller Content is
            provided to End Users free of charge (including through the use of a coupon code) (collectively the
            &quot;Transaction Fees&quot;). Any Set-Up Fees, Subscriptions Fees, and Transaction Fees will be referred to
            collectively as the &quot;Fees.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Set-Up fees will be charged to credit card, debit card, or other payment method (&quot;Payment Method&quot;)
            provided at the time of set up. If Seller&apos;s Subscription Plan requires payment of a Subscription Fee,
            Seller: (a) agrees to pay the applicable Subscription Fees in advance at the initial term of the
            Subscription and on the date of each renewal (including any applicable sales and use taxes, duties or other
            governmental taxes or fees), and to reimburse Publica for all collection costs and interest for any overdue
            amounts; (b) will provide a Payment Method at the time of subscribing to such Subscription Plan, and will
            update such information as necessary to maintain a valid Payment Method on file at all times; and (c)
            authorizes Publica or its designated payment processors to store your Payment Method and other related
            information and automatically charge your Payment Method for all amounts due under this Agreement.

            AUTORENEWAL: SELLER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT ITS SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE SAME
            DURATION, AND THAT SELLER&apos;S PAYMENT METHOD WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CHARGED FOR THE APPLICABLE

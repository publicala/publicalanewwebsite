## Conversion Commands

```bash
# Install cwebp (macOS)
brew install webp

# Install cwebp (Ubuntu/Debian)
apt-get install webp

# Convert with quality setting (for photos)
cwebp -q 85 input.jpg -o output.webp

# Convert with higher quality (for UI screenshots)
cwebp -q 90 input.png -o output.webp

# Convert with lossless (for logos with transparency)
cwebp -lossless input.png -o output.webp

# Resize and convert (using ImageMagick first)
magick input.jpg -resize 1920x1280\> -quality 100 temp.jpg
cwebp -q 85 temp.jpg -o output.webp
rm temp.jpg

# Batch conversion example
for img in *.jpg; do cwebp -q 85 "$img" -o "${img%.jpg}.webp"; done

# Convert GIF to WebP (use ImageMagick)
magick input.gif output.webp
```

## Automated Conversion Script

The conversion process used the following approach:

1. **Team Photos**: Resized to max 1920x1280 (large) or 1200x800 (standard), quality 85
2. **Hero/Feature Images**: Resized to max 1440x900, quality 90
3. **Logos**: Lossless compression to preserve transparency
4. **Theme Images**: Resized to 640x360 for aspect-video display

## Reference Updates

To update image references after conversion:

```bash
# Update specific file extensions in TypeScript/JSX files
sed -i '' 's/\.png"/.webp"/g' components/*.tsx
sed -i '' 's/\.jpg"/.webp"/g' components/*.tsx
sed -i '' 's/\.jpeg"/.webp"/g' components/*.tsx
sed -i '' 's/\.gif"/.webp"/g' components/*.tsx

# Always create backups before bulk updates
cp file.tsx file.tsx.bak
```

## Expected Results
- **File size reduction**: 60-80% for photos, 25-40% for graphics
- **Total savings**: ~8-10MB reduction in image assets
- **Performance impact**: 
  - Improved Interactive time (target: <4000ms)
  - Reduced Total Blocking Time
  - Performance score: 70 → 80+

## Actual Results (Completed)
- **Images converted**: 53 files to WebP format
- **Size reduction**: 16MB → 3.2MB (80% reduction)
- **Performance improvements** (dev mode):
  - Performance Score: 27% → 99%
  - Interactive Time: 30.2s → 0.73s (97% reduction)
  - Total Blocking Time: 2.6s → 92ms (96% reduction)
  - Largest Contentful Paint: 588ms
- **Notable conversions**:
  - Team photos: 11.6MB → ~2MB
  - OG image: 2.7MB → 7.2KB
  - Marketplace interface: 570KB → 41KB

## Clean Up
After verifying everything works in production:
1. Remove original PNG/JPG/JPEG files from public/images
2. Delete public/images-backup directory
3. Consider implementing responsive images with srcset for further optimization

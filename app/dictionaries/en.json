The Starter plan at $20/month is ideal for individuals and small teams just getting started with digital publishing. The Growth plan at $249/month is designed for growing publishers with expanding catalogs and more advanced needs. The Enterprise plan starting from $492/month is for established publishers with large catalogs requiring comprehensive features and support."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan later?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. When upgrading, the new features will be available immediately, and you'll be billed the prorated difference for the remainder of your billing cycle. When downgrading, the changes will take effect at the start of your next billing cycle."

      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I exceed my plan limits?",
        "answer": "If you approach your plan limits (such as number of publications or storage), we'll notify you so you can either upgrade to a higher plan or manage your resources. We don't automatically charge for overages, but continued usage beyond your plan limits may affect performance."
      },

        "question": "Do you offer discounts for educational institutions or non-profits?",

The Enterprise plan includes 24/7 priority support via email and phone, plus a dedicated account manager to help with your specific needs."

# Deployment Workflow Rules

## Automatic Deployments
- **Production**: Automatic deployment to production when pushing to `main` branch
- **Feature Branches**: Automatic deployment to unique subdomains when opening PRs on GitHub
- **No Local Builds**: Do not generate builds locally - deployments are fully automated
- **No Local Deploys**: Do not deploy builds locally - all deployments happen automatically

## Wrangler.toml Modifications
**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Always ask for confirmation before modifying wrangler.toml
- Changes to wrangler.toml can affect production deployment
- Get explicit user approval before any modifications
- Explain what changes will be made and why

## Workflow Summary
1. Code changes → Push to branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys
3. No manual build or deploy steps needed
4. Production updates automatically from main branch
5. Feature previews available on PR subdomains
